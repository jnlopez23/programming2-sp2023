<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>This recipe came to me in the form of an Amex promotion featuring the model, Karlie Kloss. Karlie, who also has a cookie company called Karlie’s Kookies, shared a recipe for her “Perfect 10 Kookies”, which are vegan, gluten free cookies sweetened with agave.</p>

<h3>Ingredients that you will need:</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 cup toasted slivered almonds (or other nut of your choice)</li>
<li>2/3 cup olive or coconut oil
2/3 cup agave nectar (or any sweetener such as honey or maple syrup)</li>
<li>2 Tbsps vanilla</li>
<li>1 Tbsp nut butter</li>
<li>2 cups gluten free rolled oats</li>
<li>2 cups almond flour</li>
<li>1/2 cup gluten free flour (or 2 Tbsps corn starch)</li>
<li>1 tsp salt</li>
<li>1 Tbsp + 1 tsp ground flax seed</li>
<li>1/2 cup chocolate chips (vegan)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Cooking instructions:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Toast 1 cup slivered almonds in oven at 300oF until browned (or another nut of your choice).</li>
	<li>While nuts are toasting, combine your wet ingredients (oil, sweetener, vanilla, nut butter) in one bowl.</li>
	<li>Then combine your dry ingredients (oats, almond flour, gluten free four, salt, flax, chocolate chips) in another bowl.</li>
	<li>Add wet & dry ingredients together and mix.</li>
	<li>Take out your cookie sheet and spray OR use parchment paper.</li>
	<li>Scoop your cookies any size you want them. Use hands to pat them down because cookies don’t puff or spread. They will hold exact shape that you leave them in as dough before you put them in the oven.</li>
	<li>Bake at 300oF for approximately 15 minutes (my cookies needed about 20 minutes).</li>
</ol>
